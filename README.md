Flow of Project

conn.js
When the application starts, it connects to the MongoDB database using Mongoose..
index.js
The Express server is initialized.
Middleware for handling CORS and parsing JSON requests is set up.
The database connection is established by calling connectToMongogo.
The server listens on a specified port for incoming requests.
Route files for authentication, discussion, comments, and likes are included and mounted on specific API paths.
middleware/auth.js
Middleware checks if incoming requests have a valid JWT token.
It verifies the token and attaches the user information to the request object.
Routes requiring authentication use this middleware to protect them.
